Welcome to the carob data page!

**Carob** project aims to create reproducible workflows that reshape primary agricultural research data from experiments and surveys into a standard format, and to aggregate individual data sets into larger collections that can be used in further research.

We do this by writing an R script for each individual dataset. Feel free to improve these scripts, or provide new ones through a pull request (see below for more info). You can learn more about how to contribute to carob along some guidelines [here](https://github.com/reagro/carob/wiki).

You can download the data in two different ways. Please select one below.
